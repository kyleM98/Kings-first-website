     <h1>To start off, what is a scrum?</h1> 

      <p>A <strong>scrum</strong> is a framwork which allows for a more improved and efficient for of teamwork for software developers. It does this by encouraging a team t learn through experiences, reflecting on their victories and failures and also working on possible problems.(Although i'm mostly reffering to software development, it is good to note that the framework of a Scrum can be applied to any form of teamwork.)</p>

     <h1>Sprints</h1>

      <p>These are a short period of time in which a goel for a certain amount of work is set to be achieved and ready to be reviewed, if done correctly <em>sprints</em> allowed for fewer overall mistakes in end products and help increase levels of teamwork. So overall a Sprint takes a large project and breaks it down into parts and sets goals to achieve the individual parts before moving onto the next ones.
       <h4>There are typically 4 steps to a sprint in order for it to be successful:</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>Sprint planning</li>
            <li>Daily scrum/ stand-up</li>
            <li>Sprint review</li>
            <li>Sprint retrospective</li>
         </ol> 
      </p>   
 
     <h2><em>Sprint planning:</em></h2>

      <p>This is a key event neccessary to kick-start any sprint, it is a meeting which includes the entire **Scrum** team. During this meeting the **Product owner** would describe their desired objective/ goal and then its down to the team to answer to very important questions:
       <ol>
        <li>What is possible for them to achieve within the time frame?</li>
        <li>How are they going to achieve this?</li>
       </ol>  
      </p>

     <h2><em>Daily Scrum:</em></h2>

      <p>The daily scrum or stand-up is a short period of time taken every morning, before the team go off to work on their tasks, where the gather round and discuss and inform eachother of their most recent progress/ contributions. They typically aim to answer 3 questions:

        <ol>
         <li>What have you completed/ achieved the previous day?</li>
         <li>What do you plan to achieve today?</li>
         <li>Are there any complications which may be stopping you from progressing?</li>
        </ol> 

     <h2><em>Sprint review:</em></h2>

       <p>This takes place toward the end of the <em>sprint</em> and is where the team comes together in order to discuss and demonstrate what it is that they have completed. The team memers would gather for an informal discussion on what they have completed for that itteration.</p>
